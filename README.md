## About Me

I’m a seasoned Network Administrator with over a decade of experience in infrastructure deployment, LTE data optimization, digital signage networks, and enterprise hardware support. Currently sharpening my cybersecurity skillset through Northwestern’s bootcamp, while also preparing for Security+ and Splunk certification exams.

I’ve led projects across system hardening, phishing simulations, penetration testing, and SOC development—bridging the gap between enterprise reliability and modern security defense.
